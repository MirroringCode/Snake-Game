# Snake-Game
A simple snake game for browser

## This snake game was made for educational purposes.

The tutorial i used in order to make this game can be found here: https://dev.to/nitdgplug/learn-javascript-through-a-game-1beh.

The game was created to understand important concepts of vanilla javascript, and i wanted to make sure to thank the person who made the original tutorial
and by no means i want to plagiarize it nor claim that i made it, and I'm showing it here so everyone can see the results. Even though I'm still learning this particular field that is programming
i hope this shows i've done a good job, and in the future be able to create more complex projects.
